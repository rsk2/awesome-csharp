Code snippets about the lesser known features of c-sharp

This repository is generally for me to learn or revise features of C#. I am happy to share these code snippets and I hope it is useful for others. 

Unless mentioned otherwise, code is present in **Program.cs**. 

**1. String.Join**
String.Join makes it easier to join elements of an array together in a string and we don't need to write a loop
 
 **2. String Interpolation**
 This technique makes us write more readable to embed variables in a string without using String.Format or concatenations.
 
 **3. Ref vs out**
 Difference between ref and out is that a variable used as out need not be initialized before usage.
 
 **4. Anonymous functions**
 Functions in just a single line of code. 

 **5. HashSet**
 A useful collection

  **6. List comprehensions**
  Can we do in C# what we do in python?
  
  **7. Class: InitializingVariables.cs**
  The methods in the class visually show different coding techniques to initialize different types of variables
  
  **8. Finding common elements between arrays in one line using LINQ**
  The power of LINQ lets us reduce several lines of code into one single line
